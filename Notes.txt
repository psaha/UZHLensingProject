Stuff I should get the program to print:

What's being put in ie. data and model

What you get out ie. parameter values

Opportunity to enter your own model

Label graph title axes etc, try to make it obvious which is param model and which is pix model?



Stuff I've tested

Adding runtime calculator - currently prints 0 runtime which is probably to do with when it starts measuring it. To be tested further later

Stuff I should get the program to print:

What's being put in ie. data and model

What you get out ie. parameter values

Label graph title axes etc, try to make it obvious which is param model and which is pix model?



Stuff I've tested

Adding runtime calculator - currently prints 0 runtime which is probably to do with when it starts measuring it. To be tested further later

Test argument parsing with the cuboid code and see if I can translate the idea across

Suggestion: maybe have a collection of potential parameterised models and the user can choose one depending on the data going in? 
Eg. a particular type of gravitational lens is more likely to look like model a and another like model b. Something to ask about...
Probably easier than finding a way to type in a whole model such that the program would understand.

Alternative idea is make it into a module

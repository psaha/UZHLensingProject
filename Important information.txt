Important information explaining the code and data


***********************
Explanation of files containing models and parameters:

Lens candidates.txt contains a list of all the lens candidates from the 
Spacewarps paper in order of likelihood of being a lens (as ranked by volunteers).
Models made are written down, ** means it was modelled by a volunteer (and not me), 
?????????? means I couldn't load the lens, double means the lens is a double 
and some have comments on the shape of the model. Any after the line: 
"Glass files downloaded up to here**************" have not been downloaded from 
the website yet.

All the parameters collected for simulated lenses can be found in Com_params_w_oldsims.txt
All parameters for candidate lenses can be found in candidate_params_angles.txt

Note there is also candidate_params.txt, compare_params.txt and comp_params_angle_conversion.txt
These all have either subsets of the data, or data with the angles not yet converted to lie in the range -90 - 90

N.B. Old lenses units conversion factor for Einstein radius: multiply by 0.185*440/5

All graphs for simulated lenses can be found in graph.py
All graphs for candidate lenses can be found in Candidate_graphs.py

A nice tidy list of the data plotted in graph.py can be found in compare_params_tidy.txt
N.B. this isn't set up for plotting, just for looking at - the same data is plotted by graph.py from Com_params_w_oldsims.txt

************************
Explanation of python code:

The most important files are mass_final.py and ellip.py
The lens goes into ellip.py and mass_final.py does the fitting and prints the parameters and some graphs
It should all be commented sufficiently to make sense.

Other useful files are:
ellip_spacewarps.py (ellip.py but for the old simulation models)
testfile.py (fits a very good ellipse model but parameters aren't useful)
metrop.py (for the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method)
mass_ellip_copy.py (probably contains most information on abandoned methods eg. MCMC which has been tidied up from mass_final)
readmass.py (the original code: contains rubble of abandoned methods if they can't be found elsewhere)

Other files are either previous versions of ellip.py or mass_final.py, 
failed experiments (see power.py and chisq.py) or coding rubble that's probably 
no longer useful
